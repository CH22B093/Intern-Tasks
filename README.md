5.Usage Flow:
  ->System loads medical dataset from specified folder
  ->User enters medical question
  ->System processes input through two parallel paths:
          Entity recognition (displays medical entities)
          Semantic matching (finds best answer)
  ->Displays:
          Recognized medical entities
          Original question
          Most relevant answer
          
## Task 4
